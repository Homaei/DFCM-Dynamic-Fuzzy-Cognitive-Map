# FCM
FCM is a simple program to calculate the value of the concepts of a cognitive map. It follows the traditional literature and authors like Kosko and Carlsson. Basically, it is a Hopfield neural network, although in the incidence matrix connections between the same node can appear. Furthermore, we employed a dynamic update of the weights based on Hebbian learning. The FCM represents a model of a system. Used to create attitudes, shaping ideas and make decisions.  #FCM #Fuzzy #Cognitive #MAP #Decisionmaking #Matlab #Code #algorithms
